# TEI-conversions: how to contribute

Currently, a number of conversion scripts to and form TEI as used by CLARIN.SI exists, but they
are scattered over various repositories.  The idea is that they are, sooner or later, added to
this repository in a controlled fashion.

Technically, this will be done by the standard mechanism of GitHub, i.e. first cloning this
repository to a GitHub repository owned by the author of the scripts to be added, and then
making a pull request to this repository.

It is not yet clear how many scripts and in which repositories exist, so, as a first
approximation, pls. make a directory inside the [Contributions/](Contributions/) directory, put
your scripts there and write a README.md to explain what the script do and how to run them. Of
course, it would be also nice if the scripts are commented internally.

# TEI-conversions: Contributed scripts

This directory is meant to contain subdirectories, each one then containing the script from one source.
The subdirectory should also contain a README.md to explain what the script do and how to run them. Of
course, it would be also nice if the scripts are commented internally.

See also [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md).
